*               It is a hook function that will get called if a call to

*               the kernel whenever a task, queue, timer or semaphore is
*               created.  It is also called by various parts of the demo
*               application.  If heap_1.c or heap_2.c are used, then the size of
*               the heap available to pvPortMalloc() is defined by
*               configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE in FreeRTOSConfig.h, and the
*               xPortGetFreeHeapSize() API function can be used to query the
*               size of free heap space that remains (although it does not
*               provide information on how the remaining heap might be
*               fragmented).
